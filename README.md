### Essentials of Data Visualization on Microsoft Excel

This repository documents my learning and practice from a course titled "Essentials of Data Visualization on MS Excel". The course is divided into two comprehensive modules, covering both fundamental visualization techniques and introductory statistical analysis, all executed within Microsoft Excel.

---

- **Module 1**: Foundations of Data Visualization in Excel

This module introduces the core concepts and tools of visualizing data in Excel to derive insights and communicate patterns effectively.

  - Data Visualization

     - Understanding the importance of visualizing data for storytelling and decision-making.
     - Recognizing which chart type suits specific data patterns or objectives.

 - Use of Data

    - Loading, preparing, and cleaning datasets for visualization.
    - Ensuring proper formatting to allow for smooth chart generation and analysis.

- Use of Tables

    - Converting raw data ranges to Excel Tables for structured formatting.
    - Enabling automatic expansion, filtering, and better integration with formulas and charts.

- Use of Charts

  - Creating and formatting a variety of charts including:

     -Bar Charts
     -Line Graphs
     -Pie Charts
     -Column Charts
     -Scatter Plots
      NB: Understanding which chart best represents categorical or numerical variables.

- Data Dashboards

   - Combining charts, tables, slicers, and KPI visuals into dynamic dashboards.
   - Using interactivity (e.g., slicers, pivot charts) to allow users to explore different views of the data.

- Data Modification

   - Cleaning and preparing datasets through:

      - Sorting and filtering
      - Removing duplicates
      - Using formulas and conditional formatting for enhanced readability

- **Module 2**: Statistical Visualization & Analysis in Excel

This module focuses on descriptive and inferential statistics, all visualized through Excel tools.

  - Creating Distributions from Data

  - Constructing frequency tables and visual distributions to observe patterns.

- Quantitative Data Analysis

    - Working with numerical datasets to uncover central tendencies and variability.

- Histograms

   - Visualizing distributions using Excel histograms, adjusting bin size to reveal patterns.

- Descriptive Measures

   - Calculating and interpreting:

       - Measures of Location: Mean, Median, Mode
       -  Measures of Variability: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation

- Measures of Association Between Variables

   - Exploring the relationship between variables using:

       - Covariance
       - Correlation Coefficients (e.g., Pearson’s r)

- Cross Tabulation:

  - Summarizing data using Pivot Tables to view the relationship between two categorical variables.

- Relationship Between Two Quantitative Variables:

   - Using Scatter Plots and Trendlines to explore and visually assess relationships.

- Trends in Time Series Data:

  - Plotting time-based data with line graphs to observe growth, seasonality, and fluctuations.

- Linear Regression:

  - Visualizing and interpreting Simple Linear Regression in Excel:

     - Creating a best-fit line through scatter plot
     - Displaying regression equation and R² value
     - Using the model to predict future values

- **Learning Outcomes**

Through this course, I gained a hands-on understanding of:

- Turning raw data into **visual insights**
- Using **Excel as both a visualization and statistical tool**
- Building **dashboards** that communicate key performance indicators clearly
- Performing **basic statistical analysis** directly within Excel
